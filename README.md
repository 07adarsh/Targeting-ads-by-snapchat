# Targeting-ads-by-snapchat
Snapchat offers targeted advertising options to advertisers, allowing them to reach specific audiences based on various criteria.
Here In this project I try to visualise the effect of snapchat ads  in our day to day decisions. Advertisers can target users based on demographics, interests, behavior, location, device, and operating system. 
They can also use features like lookalike audiences and custom audiences to reach users with similar characteristics to their existing customer base or those who have engaged with their brand previously. Sometime it is better for a customer but it is affecting us badly.
Snapchat's ad targeting options aim to make advertising campaigns more effective by reaching the right users who are likely to be interested in the products or services being promoted.
Here I try to visualise the How Snapchat Ads Targert us.
